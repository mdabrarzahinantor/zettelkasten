# Dream Intensive 2 Day 1

- Quran is easy for the purpose of remembrance. If anybody put try and effort in Quran indeed he will be successful in sha ALLAH. Angels discuss about us also.
- There are 3 kinds of Arabic →
  1. Street Arabic — Different dialects of Arabic in different parts of country. Example: In Arabic we can say “كيف الحال؟” which means “How are you?” In some places in the world they say “Cheif Halaz” in stead of that. On contrary Egyptian says “إزياك”. Arabic of Pen is “قلم” and in some places of Arab its pronounced as “الم” and in the other places they just say “لم”
  2. Fus-Ha — aka Modern Standard Arabic.
  3. Classical Arabic ( لغة العرب ) — In short we can say it as Ancient Arabic which the Arabs of Ancient people talks and its the language of Quran also.
     1. Classical vs Fus-Ha → Fus-Ha is just a subset of Classical Arabic. If a table is Classical then the Book on that can be compared as Fus-Ha Arabic
- There are 3 kinds of words in Arabic. It means if I highlight this 3 types of words in any Arabic book there will be no word left alone. If I touch any word that is either ISM FI’L & HARF →
  1. ISM — Big words
  2. FI’L — Big words
  3. HARF — Small words
- ISM →
  - ISM is person, place, things, ideas, adjective, adverb & more
  - Person — Lebron James, Kobe Brayant, etc.
  - Thing — Paper, Computer, Keyboard, etc.
  - Place — Bangladesh, Chittagong, USA, UK, Afghanistan etc.
  - Idea — Expectation, Kindness, Love, Mercy, Hate, Sadness, Beauty, Faith, Education, Constitution, Dream, Brightness etc.
  - Adjective — Kindly, Bright, Humble, Beautiful, Fat, etc.
  - Adverb — Happily, Nicely, Lovingly.
  - Adverbs basically answers question How did something happen. Most of them end with “ly” at the end although there might be exception. Like if you ask How did he speak? answer will be “ Quickly “ — this quickly is defining how did he speak that’s why Quickly is an adjective.
- FI’L →
  - A word that has a tense. ( Past present or future )
- If it is not FI’L or HARF that must be ISM
  - Same to previous for HARF & ISM
  - This is Process of Elimination
- Practice Time
- Sometimes Typing is in present tense like “ He is typing “ but it can be an idea also like “Typing is fun”.
- 4 Properties of ISM →
  1. Status
  2. Number
  3. Gender
  4. Type
- There are 3 forms of Status:
  - ( Subject ) Doer of the act: مرفوع | رفع, Saying something in RAF’ form is same as saying MARFOO’.
    1. The book taught me a lot, First thing is to find the FI’L.
  - ( Object ) Detail of the act? — MANSOOB
  - ( POSSESSIVE ) Word after ‘of’ — MAJROOR [49:00]
- Practice
- The student was sleeping →
  - **Who was sleeping? → Its the doer or the main question.**
  - How were they sleeping? — Detail Question
  - When were they sleeping? — Detail Question
  - Where were they sleeping? — Detail Question
  - Why were they sleeping? — Detail Question
  - Who’s student was it? — Nothing cuz it don’t have FI’L in it.
- You can question anything but if its not about the FI’L then its not a detail question.
- Teacher’s Student means — Student of The Teacher
  - My Car means — Car of Mine
- Practice by →
  1. Underline the FI’L
  2. Every ISM should be labeled R / N / J
  3. Every HARF should be labeled as H

       2. AANI 2R AYNI 2N AYNI 2J
       3. AATUN 2RF AATIN 2NF AATIN 2JF
    3. Pronouns are Crazy
       1. Independent ones are RAF’, doesn’t matter how they sound
       2. Attached one always NASB or JARR, doesn’t matter how they sound
  - **ال doesn’t make a word light instead ال doesn’t like TANWEEN**
- Grammar has to parts →
  - الصرف — Morphology
  - النحو — Grammar
- I came (bi) with a pen and a notebook and a snack... Does it only mean “with a pen” and not “with a notebook or snack”... no this with when it come with “and” that means its have a package this with used once at the beginning and you have to imagine “with a notebook” “with a snack”, total 3 time because of those and.
- Practice RAF NASB JARR from Quran
- By default an ISM is heavy. Muslim chart are heavy. An ISM is made light by removing the extra ‘n’ sound. Do this by →
  - Removing double accent ( Tanween ) or
  - Remove the extra ن at the end of the ISM
- ال doesn’t like Tanween but an ISM with ال isn’t considered light
- If any word has tanween of ( ََ ) then there will be an extra alif at the end of the word. And guess what, when the anween will be removed and َ is just single then there will be no Alif at the end. عَيْنَا is an example.
- رسولا is not light of رسولاََ. But the question is how you will be able to indicate it as light or not? Look at the ending of the word. there is an extra Alif. Extra Alif comes when there is ََ at the end. But when the exact word become light no Alif will come in the end. If there is ا at the end of a word and that word is seeming like light the word is actually light of pair RAF’ or NASB group.
- You can cut the nails not the fingers by making a word light.
