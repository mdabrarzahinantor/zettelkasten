## HOW TEACHING WORKS!

- How teaching works is like teacher all gives from him in teaching and student have to give his full in learning.
- You can feel that you need to take step number 375 but the teacher want to take at step 11. But what about step 375, I don’t know? Yes! you don’t know, because you got to take step number 11 first.

## ANXIETY KILLS LEARNING

- Anxiety kills learning, stop being anxious. Don’t think about what you don’t know, think and practice what you know.
- Sometimes question is damaging you, that doesn’t mean I don’t like questions! But sometimes I have to say not yet or soon we will answer. I have the knowledge to answer that now but if I answer you it will make no sense to you. Rather it can make you more anxious and mess what you learned until now
- Improve your attention span, you don’t come to social media for larger size videos, rather you come for bit size information, and even while the video is open you are looking here and there, how can it help you? I previously said that this intensive will help you if you can put your distractions aside and focus on what is in front of you.

## PATIENT!

- How will say we seek refuge? All is coming. You are like tasted a drop of water and trying to know when the flood is coming. Solidify what you learnt.

## YOU NEED AN OUTSIDER VIEW

- You need an outsider view. I can’t look at English as a science. Cuz its my mother language. Arabs will always be better in speaking Arabic. They don’t have to know science of Makharij necessary, still that can be outstanding in them because it comes to them naturally. But we are one kind of watching Arabic as math. Like the properties are matching, sounds are corresponding. But the Arabs they don’t have to see Arabic as a math, they don’t have to learn Mudhaf or Mudhaf Ilaih, because it have come to them from their environment.

## REVIEWS

- There are three kinds of Arabic
  1. Colloquial Arabic — Different dialects in different parts of the world and even different dialects in the same country.
  2. Formal Arabic — Aka Standard Arabic or ٱلْعَرَبِيَّةُ ٱلْفُصْحَىٰ , In English University books they call it Modern Standard Arabic.
  3. Classical Arabic — Language of the ancient Arab, its the language of the Quran and of the poets on middle age Arab in the time of early Islam. There are some differences in MSA and Classical Arabic
- In Classical Arabic there are 3 kinds of words:
  1. ISM — Person, Place, Things, Adjective, Adverb, Idea and more
  2. FI’L — The word stuck in past, present or future. Most closely compared to verb in English.
  3. HARF — Nonsense unless another word comes after it. Closest synonym in English is preposition
- ISM has 4 properties that we have to learn:
  1. Status →
     1. Forms of Status
        1. RAF’ — The doer of the FI’L and other thing
        2. NASB — Detail of the Act or FI’L or Something comes after the HARF of NASB
        3. JARR — Word that comes after “of” basically. But it also show its face if any HARF of JARR comes before it
     2. How to tell status
        1. Ending Sound
           1. UN / U — RAF’
           2. AN / A — NASB
           3. IN / I — JARR
        2. Ending Combination
           1. Pair Combination
              1. AANI / AA — MUSLIMAANI — 2 RAF’
              2. AYNI / AY — MUSLIMAYNI — 2 NASB / JARR
              3. TAANI / TAA — MUSLIMATAANI — 2 RAF’ FEM
              4. TAYNI / TAY — MUSLIMATAYNI — 2 NASB / JARR FEM
           2. Plural Combination
              1. OONA / OO — MUSLIMOONA — 3 RAF’ ( Uses only for people and also for male and female together )
              2. EENA / EE — MUSLIMEENA — 3 NASB / JARR ( Uses only for people and also for male and female together )
              3. AATUN / AATU — MUSLIMAATUN — 3 RAF’ FEM ( Non human things or only for women )
              4. AATIN / AATI — MUSLIMAATIN — 3 NASB / JARR FEM ( Non human things or only for women )
           3. Pronouns
              1. Independent Pronouns are RAF’
              2. Attached pronouns can only be JARR / NASB
     3. Light vs Heavy — ISM has two ending with extra noon and without extra noon. If any word is pronounced with extra noon will be considered as Heavy and if the noon is removed the word will be taken as Light.
        - Rather the ISM is by default Heavy
        - All of Page 6 is Heavy
        - If there is ال on an ISM we don’t dare to question about Light or Heavy. Remember ال only removes the Tanween.
        - 4 Reasons to make a word light.
