# Dream Intensive 2 Day 2

- كتابُُ كِتابََ كتابِِ — Here after the double tanween there is an extra Alif. And It will always come if there is double Jabr at the end except if any ة comes at the end. Like رحمةََ there is no extra Alif at the end. And there is no Alif if it is light كتبَ No extra Alif will come after it.
- But the confusing part is if there is extra Alif and it is light. رسوْلا ، قوْلا there are an extra Alif at the and they are light! So we can conclude it is not the light version of ending sound.
- Feminine plural combination can be used for anything. But masculine plural combination must be used for people.
- لَعِبْرَةََ — This ل is not Harf of Jarr. Because when it start it start with لِ sound but when this ل used for emphasize it will not used as لِ . This ل is called ل of emphasize. عبرة means lesson. But when the ل comes before it it become emphasized and meaning might sound as **LESSON.** ل can be hang out anywhere, it can come with an Ism, a pronoun whatever it is. He doesn’t change any status. It does nothing.
- There are four reasons for a ism to be light:
  1. Mudhaf
  2. Partly Flexible
  3. Calling someone
  4. Absolutely NO
- There are three categories of flexibility
  - In a country there are 3 kinds of people CITIZEN, LEGAL RESIDENTS, ILLEGALS. They are treated differently. CITIZENS have all the right. They can do whatever they want. ILLEGALS they don’t have almost no rights. They can’t have voting permission, they can’t have passport, etc. LEGAL RESIDENTS have some rights. As a blueprint we can say →
    1. CITIZENS — All rights
    2. LEGAL CITIZENS — Some Rights
    3. ILLEGAL CITIZENS — No Rights
    Unlike these, Some words in Arabic can have any statuses. They can form heavy or light version if they want. [ مسلم ] Some words can only have one form. They can’t be heavy. [ ذلك ] And similar to LEGAL CITIZENS some words can switch to different forms but not to all forms. [ ابرهيم ]
  1. Fully Flexible
     - Most Isms are fully flexible. Page 6
     - Can be heavy or light
     - Can show all statuses
     - Muslim Chart on Page 6
     - If any name is spelled in three letters they can be Fully Flexible
  2. Non Flexible
     - Only have one form
     - Looks the same in all statuses
     - Some words that are non-flexible:
       - Words ending in Alif. مُوسَى
       - Single & Plural ism mowsool
       - The singular and the plural pointing words
  3. Partly Flexible
     - Partly flexible is always Light
     - Name of Places
       - New Yourk, Chichago these are the specific name. And City, Village, Garden these are words for places not any name of place.
       - جنة meaning Garden. We are saying not to any usual garden. Although its a word for place but for muslim Jannah is specific gift for Mumin.

    - and it doesn’t have a **combination**
    - but instead has an **ending sound**, it has to be broken plural
